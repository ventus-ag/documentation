Linux Virtual Machine - that was created with the next parameters and has IP: 185.226.41.42: Name: test-1; Flavor: VC-2; Image: ubuntu-server-18.04-LTS-20201111; Key pair: main; Networks: public; Firewalls: default; Volume size: 50. For more information about creating and configuring these resources, see the following articles: SSH Keys, Virtual Machines.\nConfiguring Firewalls By default, all created Virtual Machines belong to the default Firewall, which allows access to the Internet from the VM, but denies almost all access on the VM from outside, except for objects belonging to the same default Firewall. Thus, using only the default Firewall, we cannot connect to the selected Virtual Machine remotely via SSH.\nDefault Firewall allows all outbound traffic and controls the inbound traffic that\u0026rsquo;s allowed to reach the VMs that are associated with the default Firewall too.\nThere are two ways how to resolve this:\nto add an additional Firewall with a rule that will allow incoming traffic to TCP port 22 on the Virtual Machines and assign this Firewall to the VM too; to add the required rule to the Firewall (can be default Firewall) that is already assigned to the Virtual Machine. Create New Firewall with required rule To create new Firewall do the following:\nopen the Firewalls page - for this select the Security from the VIRTUAL DATACENTER block and click on the FIREWALL TAB: on the Firewalls page click on the CREATE FIREWALL icon in the upper left corner; fill in the form on the next opened Create Firewall window and click on the CREATE icon: After these steps, the newly created Firewall will be added to the Firewalls page.\nAs a next step, we need to add an additional Firewall with a rule that will allow incoming traffic to TCP port 22 on the Virtual Machines.\nTo add the described above rule to the newly created Firewall do the following:\nopen the Firewall Rules page - for this click on the Name of the corresponding Firewall: on the Firewall Rules page you can see that rules, that allow all outbound traffic, have been already created by default, but can be deleted if needed. To add additional rule here click on the CREATE FIREWALL RULE icon in the upper left corner: fill in the form on the next opened Create Firewall Rule window as shown below and click on the CREATE icon: This newly added rule will allow access to the TCP port 22 on the all VMs in the created Firewall over the public Internet, but if you want to allow access only on the one selected VM, you need to specify IP of this VM / 32 in the field named Remote IP prefix - example is shown below:\nAfter this wee need to add this configured Firewall to our Virtual Machine.\nTo add this newly created Firewall to our Virtual Machine, do the following:\nopen the Virtual Machines page - for this select the Virtual Machines from the VIRTUAL DATACENTER block: open the Virtual Machine details page - click on the Name of the corresponding Virtual Machine: open the NETWORKS \u0026amp; SECURITY TAB, click on the Actions icon and select the Edit Firewalls in the list of available options: select our newly created firewall from the list on the opened window and click on SAVE: After these steps, the newly added Firewall will be added to the selected VM:\nThis is the first option, how we can configure the Firewall for SSH access - by creating a new one with the required rule. But we can just add this rule to the default Firewall that is already assigned to our VM, and these changes will automatically be applied to the VMs. You can add and remove rules at any time. Your changes are automatically applied to the VMs that are associated with the corresponding Firewall.\nAdd required rule to the existing Firewall To add required rule to the default Firewall you need to do next:\nopen the Firewalls page - for this select the Security from the VIRTUAL DATACENTER block and click on the FIREWALL TAB: open the Firewall Rules page of the default Firewall- for this click on the Name of the corresponding Firewall: on the Firewall Rules page click on the CREATE FIREWALL RULE icon in the upper left corner;\nfill in the form on the next opened Create Firewall Rule window as shown below and click on the CREATE icon: And that\u0026rsquo;s all, this newly created Firewall Rule will be automatically applied to all Virtual Machine that were attached with this default Firewall.\nConnect using SSH Since we have the public key deployed on our Linux VM, the private key on our local system (for example ~/.ssh/id_rsa) and a Firewall configured to allow incoming traffic on port 22, we can connect to this Virtual Machine remotely from our local server via SSH, just use the next command: ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa username@10.111.22.333\nThe default usernames for various Linux distributions are as follows:\nDebian - \u0026ldquo;debian\u0026rdquo;;\nFedora - \u0026ldquo;fedora\u0026rdquo;;\nFedora CoreOS - \u0026ldquo;core\u0026rdquo;;\nCentOS 7, CentOS 8 - \u0026ldquo;centos\u0026rdquo;;\nCentOS 9 and later versions - \u0026ldquo;cloud-user\u0026rdquo;.\nIn the case of Windows, the default username is set as \u0026ldquo;ventus\u0026rdquo;.\nReplace username and 10.11.22.333 in the command with your data and specify the appropriate path to your private key. In our example, the command will look like this: sudo ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa ubuntu@185.226.41.42 After successfully connecting, you can check your internet access and try pinging google.com: "},{"uri":"https://docs.ventuscloud.eu/products/databases/database-replicas/","title":"Database&#39;s Replicas","tags":[],"description":"","content":" On this page, you can find an explanation of what is database\u0026rsquo;s Replica, how to create and manage them in the Cloud Console.\nTable of contents Table of contents Introduction Make Database\u0026rsquo;s Replica Delete Database\u0026rsquo;s Replica Introduction Database\u0026rsquo;s Replicas are a feature provided to ensure the security of your databases.

Create Firewall Rule To create new Firewall Rule, do the following:\ngo to the Firewall Rules page and click on the CREATE FIREWALL RULE icon in the upper left corner; fill in the form on the next opened Create Firewall Rule window: Description - set a description for the Rule; Direction - select a direction for the Rule: ingress or egress; Protocol - select the type of protocol for the Rule: TCP, UDP, ICMP; Port options - this field is available only for rules with TCP and UDP protocols; select one of the option, that you will provide below: Port - use this option, if your rule will be for one specific port; Port range - use this option, if your rule will be for some specific port range; All Ports - use this option, if your rule will be for all ports between 0 and 65535. Remote - select one of the option, that you will provide below: Firewall - use this option, if you want to apply this rule for the another Firewall; the selected Firewall will be associated with this rule; CIDR - use this option, if you want to apply this rule for the IP Addresses range. After these steps, the newly created Firewall Rule will be added to the Firewall Rules page.\nFirewall Rule details page To get to the Firewall Rule details page, click on the ID of the corresponding Firewall Rule: On this page you can find additional information about this Rule and quick actions icon for rule deletion: Delete Firewall Rule To delete the Firewall Rule, do the following:\nidentify this unnecessary Rule on the Firewall Rule page; click on the Actions icon and select the Delete in the list of available options; confirm the Firewall Rule deletion on the next opened Confirmation window. After these steps, the selected Firewall Rule will be deleted.\nAlso, you can delete the rule from Firewall Rule details page, by clicking on the appropriative quick actions icon there.\nFirewall Rule for SSH Protocol By default, all created Virtual Machines belong to the default Firewall, which allows access to the Internet from the VM, but denies almost all access on the VM from outside, except for objects belonging to the same default Firewall.\nThus, to open connection to the selected Linux Virtual Machine remotely via SSH, we need to add an additional Firewall with a rule, that will allow incoming traffic to TCP port 22 on the Virtual Machines, and assign this Firewall to the VM too, or just add the required rule to the Firewall that is already assigned to the Virtual Machine.\nExample of such rule you can see below: To find more information about how to connect to the Linux Virtual Machine created in the Cloud Console using SSH Protocol, please use the article - Access Linux VM.\nFirewall Rule for RDP By default, all created Virtual Machines belong to the default Firewall, which allows access to the Internet from the VM, but denies almost all access on the VM from outside, except for objects belonging to the same default Firewall.\nThus, to open connection to the selected Windows Virtual Machine remotely via RDP, we need to add an additional Firewall with a rule, that will allow incoming traffic to TCP port 54000 on the Virtual Machines, and assign this Firewall to the VM too, or just add the required rule to the Firewall that is already assigned to the Virtual Machine. Example of such rule you can see below: To find more information about how to connect to the Windows Virtual Machine created in the Cloud Console using Remote Desktop Protocol, please, use the article - Access Windows VM.\n"},{"uri":"https://docs.ventuscloud.eu/products/networking/floating-ips/","title":"Floating IPs","tags":[],"description":"","content":" On this page, you can find an explanation of how to create, associate, edit, delete Floating IPs and instructions for other steps to manage Floating IPs in the Cloud Console.\nTable of contents Table of contents Floating IP Floating IPs page Create Floating IP Associate/Disassociate Floating IP Edit Floating IP Delete Floating IP Floating IP Floating IP is an IP address allocated from Public network range by request and associated with specific project. You can assign Floating IP to any of your instances provisioned in private networks. This provides great flexibility in management of your network resources.\nSome of the key advantages provided by Floating IPs:\nOnce Floating IP created - it will stay in your project until you explicitly delete it. Regardless if you delete resources to which it attached. It guarantees that you will have your stable static IP for as long as it needed for your infrastructure. You can create multiple Floating IPs per project. You can almost immediately transfer Floating IP from one instance to another without any interruptions to service. Instance itself doesn\u0026rsquo;t know about Floating IP existence. You don\u0026rsquo;t have additional network interface on OS level. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to care about routing with multiple interfaces. You need to know that:\nFloating IP can be assigned only to instance provisioned in private network with configured router with external gateway. Only one Floating IP can be assigned to instance at one time. You can’t have Floating IP created from range of your private network. Floating IPs page To get to the Floating IPs page, select the Networking from the VIRTUAL DATACENTER block in the side-bar menu and click the Floating IPs TAB: On this page you can find all Floating IPs created in the current Project, with the Create button, Search bar and Actions icon, which opens a list of available management actions for the selected Floating IP: Actions icon opens the next list of available management actions for the selected Floating IP:\nAssociate - this option is used to associate selected Floating IP with available Network Interfaces; Disassociate - this option is available only for Floating IPs that are already associated with one of the Network Interfaces; Edit - this option is used to update description of the selected Floating IP; Delete - this option is for releasing specific Floating IP from the Project. Create Floating IP To create new Floating IP, do the following:\ngo to the Floating IPs page and click on the CREATE FLOATING IP icon in the upper left corner; optionally, add the description on the next opened Create Floating IP window and click on the CREATE icon: After these steps, the newly created Floating IP will be added to the Floating IPs page: Also, when creating Floating IP, you can immediately associate it with available Interface: If Floating IP is currently associated with one of the created Interfaces, it\u0026rsquo;s status is ACTIVE:\nAssociate/Disassociate Floating IP There are two ways to associate/disassociate already created Floating IP with the VM’s internal Interfaces\nfrom the Floating IPs page; from the NETWORKS \u0026amp; SECURITY TAB on the Virtual Machine details page. In this article we will explain the first way - how to associate/disassociate Floating IP from the Floating IPs page.\nInformation about the second one you can find in the article - VM\u0026rsquo;s Networks and Interfaces.\nAlso, as you know from the previous chapter, you can immediately associate Floating IP when you create it.\nFloating IP association can be completed successfully to VM\u0026rsquo;s interface in internal subnet with enabled external gateway.\nTo associate already created Floating IP with the VM\u0026rsquo;s internal Interfaces, do the following:\nensure that you have created VM in internal Network, which Interface you want to associate with the Floating IP.\nTo find information about how to create internal Network use the article Networks and how to create VM - article Virtual Machines; ensure that you have configured Router with enabled external gateway, which is attached to your internal Network. To find information about how to create and configure Router use the article Routers; identify the Floating IP, that you want to associate, on the Floating IPs page; click on the Actions icon and select the Associate in the list of available options; select one of the available VM\u0026rsquo;s internal Interfaces on the next opened window, and click on ASSOCIATE: After these steps, the selected Floating IP will have ACTIVE status and the associated with it VM will be publicly available: If you need to disassociate Floating IP and to make your VM again publicly unavailable, do the following:\nidentify the associated Floating IP, that you want to disassociate, on the Floating IPs page; click on the Actions icon and select the Disassociate in the list of available options: After confirmation your action on the next opened window the selected Virtual Machine will be again publicly unavailable and Floating IP has status DOWN.\nEdit Floating IP To edit the Floating IP, do the following:\nidentify the Floating IP, that you want to edit, on the Floating IPs page; click on the Actions icon and select the Edit in the list of available options; update the Description on the next opened Edit Floating IP window, and click on the SAVE icon. After these steps, the selected Floating IP will be updated.\nDelete Floating IP To delete the Floating IP, do the following:\nto identify this unnecessary Floating IP on the Floating IPs page; click on the Actions icon and select the Delete in the list of available options; confirm the Floating IP deletion on the next opened Confirmation window.

Contact support if you need it.\nThis scenario is very complex and heavily affected by OS settings inside instance.\nBinding to MAC addresses in your network configuration tool (Netplan, systemd-networkd, others) can cause networking failure.\nRouting table affected by new/changed network interfaces can cause networking failure.\nFirewalls with strict rules can cause networking failure.\nPlease. test this scenario in advance in Non-production environment.\nConclusion\nAs you can see, the port modification functionality is very powerful and let you similar functionality with what you can do with physical devices and even beyond that. But as a drawback, it leads to complexity and difficulties in configurations on many levels. We recommend avoiding working directly with ports and consider the usage of more advanced features like Floating IPs and Load Balancers except for cases when you really need it.\nFloating IP Floating IP is an IP address allocated from Public network range by request and associated with specific project. You can assign Floating IP to any of your instances provisioned in private networks. This provides great flexibility in management of your network resources.\nSome of the key advantages provided by Floating IPs:\nOnce Floating IP created - it will stay in your project until you explicitly delete it. Regardless if you delete resources to which it attached. It guarantees that you will have your stable static IP for as long as it needed for your infrastructure. You can create multiple Floating IPs per project. You can almost immediately transfer Floating IP from one instance to another without any interruptions to service. Instance itself doesn\u0026rsquo;t know about Floating IP existence. You don\u0026rsquo;t have additional network interface on OS level. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to care about routing with multiple interfaces. You need to know that:\nFloating IP can be assigned only to instance provisioned in private network with configured router with external gateway. Only one Floating IP can be assigned to instance at one time. You can’t have Floating IP created from range of your private network. Configuration\nCreate private network:\nopenstack network create private\nCreate and configure subnet:\nopenstack subnet create \\ --gateway 10.0.0.1 \\ --dns-nameserver 8.8.8.8 \\ --subnet-range 10.0.0.0/24 \\ --allocation-pool start=10.0.0.10,end=10.0.0.200 \\ --network private \\ private_subnet Create router to let instances in private network access to internet:\nopenstack router create private_gateway\nConfigure gateway for router:\nopenstack router set --external-gateway public private_gateway\nAttach router to private subnet (enable routing):\nopenstack router add subnet private_gateway private_subnet\nCreate a couple of servers in private network:\nopenstack server create \\ --image \u0026#39;centos-8.2-2004\u0026#39; \\ --boot-from-volume 100 \\ --flavor VC-4 \\ --security-group default \\ --network private \\ --key-name ssh_key_name \\ server1 openstack server create \\ --image \u0026#39;centos-8.2-2004\u0026#39; \\ --boot-from-volume 100 \\ --flavor VC-4 \\ --security-group default \\ --network private \\ --key-name ssh_key_name \\ server2 Make sure that servers created in private subnet range and you can\u0026rsquo;t connect to it over internet:\nopenstack server list\nCreate floating IP:\nopenstack floating ip create public\nShow list of floating IPs available:\nopenstack floating ip list\nAssign Floating IP to server1:\n#openstack server add floating ip server1 \u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt;\nopenstack server add floating ip server1 88.218.52.5\nVerify that you can connect to server1 over internet using Floating IP address. Make sure that you allowed SSH access on Cloud Console Firewall - to find more detailed instructions see the article - Firewall Rules:\n#ssh centos@\u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt;\nssh centos@88.218.52.5\nReassign Floating IP to server2:\n#openstack server add floating ip server2 \u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt;\nopenstack server add floating ip server2 88.218.52.5\nConnect to the same Floating IP over SSH and make sure that you are now accessing server2 instead of server1 using the very same address:\n#ssh centos@\u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt;\nssh centos@88.218.52.5\nDelete server2 and verify that Floatin IP still exists in your project and can be reused:\nopenstack server delete server2\nopenstack floating ip list\nAssign Floating IP to server1:\n#openstack server add floating ip server1 \u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt;\nopenstack server add floating ip server1 88.218.52.5\nopenstack floating ip list\nUnassign Floating IP from Any servers:\n#openstack server remove floating ip server1 \u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt;\nopenstack server remove floating ip server1 88.218.52.5\nopenstack floating ip list\nConclusion Floating IP is a great addition to your infrastructure. It\u0026rsquo;s simple to use. It let you great flexibility in performing drop-in replacement of instances. It guarantees you the stability of the IP address - once you created it will be yours until explicit termination. It can highly increase your security by running all of your workload inside a private network still being able to access the environment using jump servers with adding Public IP only for a limited time (maintenance) and others.\nLoad Balancer Load balancer is a feature designed to satisfy the needs of the most complex and modern distributed application architectures. It helps to increase the performance of your application by distributing requests over multiple instances based on the chosen algorithm as well as reduce possible interruption to service caused by failed instances by leveraging instance auto-eviction functionality based on health probes.\nConfiguration\nCreate and configure network:\nopenstack network create private openstack subnet create \\ --gateway 10.0.0.1 \\ --dns-nameserver 8.8.8.8 \\ --subnet-range 10.0.0.0/24 \\ --allocation-pool start=10.0.0.10,end=10.0.0.200 \\ --network private \\ private_subnet openstack router create private_gateway openstack router set --external-gateway public private_gateway openstack router add subnet private_gateway private_subnet Create a couple of servers in private network so we can test Load Balancer.\nThis time we will leverage User Data a.k.a. Cloud-Init feature for automatic preconfiguration of software inside newly created instance without need to login to it.\nPrepare Cloud-Init config (adjust for your OS Distro accordingly):\ncat \u0026lt;\u0026lt; EOF \u0026gt; ./server1.yaml #cloud-config runcmd: - yum install -y nginx - systemctl start nginx EOF cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt; EOF \u0026gt; ./server2.yaml #cloud-config runcmd: - yum install -y httpd - systemctl start httpd EOF Config of server1.yaml will install and start Nginx webserver on server1. Config of server2.yaml will install and enable Apache web server on server2:\nopenstack server create \\ --image \u0026#39;centos-8.2-2004\u0026#39; \\ --boot-from-volume 100 \\ --flavor VC-4 \\ --security-group default \\ --network private \\ --key-name ssh_key_name \\ --user-data ./server1.yaml \\ server1 openstack server create \\ --image \u0026#39;centos-8.2-2004\u0026#39; \\ --boot-from-volume 100 \\ --flavor VC-4 \\ --security-group default \\ --network private \\ --key-name ssh_key_name \\ --user-data ./server2.yaml \\ server2 Now we have two servers with different web servers which listen on the same port. Both of them inside a private network therefore not reachable from the internet.\nCreate Load Balancer\nUse the next command to create Load Balancer:\npenstack loadbalancer create --name web --vip-subnet-id private_subnet\nCreate Load Balancer Listener:\nopenstack loadbalancer listener create \\ --name web_listener \\ --protocol HTTP \\ --protocol-port 80 \\ web Create Load Balancer Pool:\nopenstack loadbalancer pool create \\ --name web_pool \\ --lb-algorithm ROUND_ROBIN \\ --listener web_listener \\ --protocol HTTP Get servers ip:\nopenstack server list +--------------------------------------+---------+--------+--------------------+--------------------------+--------+ | ID | Name | Status | Networks | Image | Flavor | +--------------------------------------+---------+--------+--------------------+--------------------------+--------+ | a1cb4833-c542-4cd4-b980-XXXXXXXXXXX | server2 | ACTIVE | private=10.0.0.193 | N/A (booted from volume) | VC-4 | | f4bb4bcd-6366-4bcd-83fa-XXXXXXXXXXX | server1 | ACTIVE | private=10.0.0.19 | N/A (booted from volume) | VC-4 | +--------------------------------------+---------+--------+--------------------+--------------------------+--------+ Add web servers/instances to Load Balancer\u0026rsquo;s pool (use your IP addresses):\nopenstack loadbalancer member create \\ --subnet-id private_subnet \\ --address 10.0.0.19 \\ --protocol-port 80 \\ web_pool openstack loadbalancer member create \\ --subnet-id private_subnet \\ --address 10.0.0.193 \\ --protocol-port 80 \\ web_pool Now we have preconfigured instances with installed and enabled web servers, created and configured Load Balancer, but everything is exposed only to internal network, let\u0026rsquo;s fix that by adding Floating IP to our infrastructure:\nopenstack floating ip create public\nGet IP address of Load Balancer listener:\nopenstack loadbalancer list +--------------------------------------+------+----------------------------------+-------------+---------------------+----------+ | id | name | project_id | vip_address | provisioning_status | provider | +--------------------------------------+------+----------------------------------+-------------+---------------------+----------+ | ae2a65e5-293f-455d-8cb8-XXXXXXXXXXXX | web | 17a1fd0e5a87468da287XXXXXXXXXXXX | 10.0.0.48 | ACTIVE | amphora | +--------------------------------------+------+----------------------------------+-------------+---------------------+----------+ Get Port ID of Load Balancer listener:\nopenstack port list | grep 10.0.0.48 | 71292fef-7a94-43ac-bfe3-XXXXXXXXXXXX | octavia-lb-ae2a65e5-293f-455d-8cb8-XXXXXXXXXXXX | fa:16:3e:XX:XX:XX | ip_address=\u0026#39;10.0.0.48\u0026#39;, subnet_id=\u0026#39;9efbdfb3-f86d-40f0-b07a-XXXXXXXXXXXX \u0026#39; | DOWN | Assign Previously created Floating IP to Load balancer\u0026rsquo;s Listener port:\nopenstack floating ip set --port 71292fef-7a94-43ac-bfe3-XXXXXXXXXXXX \u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt; Pro Tips:\nDespite you can create Load Balancer directly in Public network, we highly recommend using of Floating IP\u0026rsquo;s instead. This will dramatically increase your flexibility in upgrade/migration/disaster recovery scenarios but will keep all of the benefits of Load Balancer itself.\nAs result we have:\nInternal network with subnet; Router which let instances access to internet; Preconfigured instances with automatically installed web servers; Fully configured Load Balancers with pool members of two web servers; Floating IP attached to Load Balancer which exposes web services to internet over port 80. Test Load balancer Functionality:\ncurl http://\u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt; curl http://\u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt; As we configured Load Balancer to work using Round Robin algorithm expected result - different responses on each HTTP request. This means that Load Balancer equally distributes traffic between all pool members.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s recommended to use curl instead of your Browser for testing purposes because the Browsers caching mechanism can mess results.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s disable one of the web servers. You can shutdown instance or disable web server.\nExpected result - you will always receive response only from one web server because Load Balancer will automatically detect that backend instance is down.\nRestore your \u0026ldquo;broken\u0026rdquo; webserver and verify that now you receive results again from both web servers (Apache and Nginx).\nChange Load Balancer\u0026rsquo;s algorithm.\nSome applications may benefit from accepting client requests to the same instance instead of distribution across all instances:\nopenstack loadbalancer pool set --lb-algorithm SOURCE_IP web_pool\nVerify that Load Balancer\u0026rsquo;s behavior changed:\ncurl http://\u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt; curl http://\u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt; curl http://\u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt; You should always receive results only from the same server.\nSupported LB Algorithms:\nSOURCE_IP; ROUND_ROBIN; LEAST_CONNECTIONS; SOURCE_IP_PORT; In addition, Load Balancers has a much more broad functionality than it was described above. It supports multiple pools, multiple listeners, SSL offloading, advanced monitors, and other what will be described in Load Balancers dedicated documentation.\nConclusion\nLoad Balancer is a powerful and advanced feature that can enhance multiple aspects of your application starting but not limiting with traffic distribution, fault detection, smooth adding, and removing instances from pools/farms/clusters. In conjunction with private networks, routers, and Floating IP it can become a great entry point for your application.\n"},{"uri":"https://docs.ventuscloud.eu/products/security/manage-firewalls/","title":"VM&#39;s Firewalls","tags":[],"description":"","content":" On this page, you can find an explanation of how to manage Firewalls, related to the selected Virtual Machine, from the Virtual Machine details page in the Cloud Console.\nTable of contents Table of contents VM\u0026rsquo;s NETWORKS \u0026amp; SECURITY TAB Change Firewall set VM\u0026rsquo;s NETWORKS \u0026amp; SECURITY TAB To find all Firewalls, related to the selected Virtual Machine, you need:\nopen the Virtual Machines page - for this select the Virtual Machines from the VIRTUAL DATACENTER block in the side-bar menu: open the Virtual Machine details page - for this click on the Name of the corresponding Virtual Machine: open the NETWORKS \u0026amp; SECURITY page of this VM: On the opened NETWORKS \u0026amp; SECURITY page of this VM you can find information about all Networks, Subnets, Floating IPs and also information about all Firewalls related to this VM.\nIn this article, we are interested in the block of information, where you can find all Firewalls related to the corresponding VM with their Actions icon, which opens a list of available management actions: Information how to manage Networks, Subnets and Floating IPs from this page, you can find in the article VM\u0026rsquo;s Networks and Interfaces.\nChange Firewall set To add additional Firewall or delete unnecessary one from the selected VM, do the following:\nclick on the Actions icon and select the Edit Firewalls in the list of available options; remove an unnecessary firewall or select an additional one from the list of previously added firewalls and click on the SAVE icon: After these steps, the newly added Firewall will be added to the selected VM:\nYou can add and remove rules of the selected Firewall at any time from the Firewall Rules page and your changes will automatically applied to the VMs, that are associated with the corresponding Firewall.\nFor more information about Firewalls and their Rules, please, see the next articles: Firewalls, Firewall Rules.\nAlso, you can create new VM and immediately associate it with desired Firewall, during it\u0026rsquo;s creation.\nTo find information about how to create Virtual Machine use the article Virtual Machines.

It provides a fully distributed, API-accessible storage platform that can be integrated directly into applications or used for backup, archiving, and data retention.\nIt’s built for scale and optimized for durability, availability, and concurrency across the entire data set. An Object Storage API differs from a conventional filesystem: instead of directories and files, you manipulate containers where you store objects. A container can hold millions of objects.\nThere is no notion of hierarchy with containers: you cannot nest a container within another, however, you can emulate a nested folder structure with a naming convention for your objects.\nObject Storage access methods\nWe can access Object Storage using different methods:\nIntegrated S3-Browser: The Cloud Console provides its own integrated S3-Browser, which offers a user-friendly interface to manage your Object Storage resources. This browser allows you to browse through folders and files, create new folders, upload files, and perform various other management tasks directly within the Cloud Console.\nAPIs: You can also interact with Object Storage using different APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). APIs enable developers to programmatically access and manipulate Object Storage resources, allowing for more customized and automated workflows.\nThird-Party Tools: Additionally, you have the option to use third-party tools like S3 Browser and Cyberduck, which provide alternative interfaces for managing Object Storage. These tools may offer additional features and functionalities not available in the integrated S3-Browser, catering to specific user preferences and requirements.\nBy offering multiple options to access Object Storage, the Cloud Console allows users to choose the most suitable approach for their storage management needs. Whether through the integrated S3-Browser, APIs, or third-party tools, users can efficiently interact with and manage their Object Storage resources.\nBut before we start to configure and use Object Storage we need to create credentials that include the access key and secret key and will enable secure access to your Object Storage resources, allowing you to manage and interact with your data.\nObject Storage Credentials page To get to the Object Storage Credentials page, select the Storage from the VIRTUAL DATACENTER block in the side-bar menu and click the S3 Browser TAB: On this page you can find created Object Storage credentials in the current Project with the Create or Browse buckets button, Search bar and Actions icon, which opens a list of available management actions for the selected Object Storage credentials: Actions icon opens the next list of available management actions:\nShow access secret - this option is used to find the secret key of the selected Object Storage credentials; Re-generate secret - this option is used to re-generate the secret key of the selected Object Storage credentials; Delete storage - this option is for Object Storage credentials deletion. Please be aware that there are current limitations in the Cloud Console. You can create only one set of Object Storage credentials within one project.\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t created Object Storage Credentials yet, you will find the Create S3 Credentials button available in the upper left corner. Once you have created the credentials, this button will change to the Browse Buckets button, which allows you to access and manage your existing buckets using the integrated S3 browser. Keep in mind that you can only have one set of credentials per project, so ensure you have the necessary credentials before attempting to use the integrated S3 browser for bucket management.\nCreate Object Storage credentials To create a new Object Storage credentials in the Cloud Console, do the following:\ngo to the Object Storage Credentials page and click on the CREATE S3 CREDENTIALS icon in the upper left corner; confirm your action on the next opened window by clicking on the CREATE icon: The next opened page will provide your access secret key and you can save it by clicking on the COPY TO CLIPBOARD icon.\nAfter these steps, the newly created Object Storage credentials will be added to the Object Storage Credentials page.\nPlease be aware that there are current limitations in the Cloud Console. You can create only one set of Object Storage credentials within one project.\nNext steps, how to use Object Storage credentials to connect to the Cloud Object Storage in different ways you can find in the next articles - Integrated S3-Browser and Object Storage Clients.\nShow secret key To show again secret key of the created Object Storage credentials, do the following:\non the Object Storage Credentials page identify Object Storage credentials from what you want to get secret key; click on the Actions icon and select the Show access secret in the list of available options; confirm your action on the next opened window by clicking on the SHOW icon.

Use the following block of code to implement this:\nprivate_key = bucket.get_key(\u0026#39;hello.txt\u0026#39;) hello_url = hello_key.generate_url(0, query_auth=False, force_http=False) print (hello_url) For private objects we can generate a time-limited, signed download URL, that will be operational for a specific duration, after which it will become invalid.\nUse the following block of code to implement this:\nprivate_key = bucket.get_key(\u0026#39;private_data.txt\u0026#39;) private_url = private_key.generate_url(3600, query_auth=True, force_http=False) print (private_url) Please, notice here, when a client application accesses buckets, it always operates with the credentials of a particular user. As every user belongs to a particular project, therefore, for using this links you should add your project ID before your bucket name, and the working links in both examples will look like this: for publicly readable objects - \u0026ldquo;https://upper-austria.ventuscloud.eu:8080/Your_Project_ID:new-bucket-using-python/hello.txt\u0026quot;;\nfor private objects - \u0026ldquo;https://upper-austria.ventuscloud.eu:8080/Your_Project_ID:new-bucket-using-python/private_info.txt?Signature=XXX\u0026amp;Expires=1316027075\u0026amp;AWSAccessKeyId=XXX\u0026quot;\nFind your Project ID you can:\non the Overview page in the Cloud Console: in the link, when you use Cloud Console;\nDelete object To delete an object from the bucket, use the next code block:\nbucket.delete_key(\u0026#39;hello.txt\u0026#39;) It deletes a file \u0026ldquo;hello.txt\u0026rdquo; from the bucket.\nDeleting bucket To delete a whole bucket use the next code block:\nconn.delete_bucket(\u0026#34;1-bucket-using-python\u0026#34;) It deletes the whole bucket called \u0026ldquo;1-bucket-using-python\u0026rdquo;.\nUse Object Storage with third-party tools Another way to utilize the Cloud Console Object Storage and manage data stored in it is by using third-party tools.\nSome of these tools include:\nS3 Browser - a freeware Windows client that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the Cloud Console Object Storage. You can find more information about it at https://s3browser.com/.\nCyberduck - a libre server and cloud storage browser available for both Mac and Windows operating systems. It offers seamless integration with the Cloud Console Object Storage and can be accessed at https://cyberduck.io/.\nIn this section, we will explore how to use the Windows client S3 Browser to interact with the Cloud Console Object Storage and manage your data effectively.\nTo download and install it on your computer, go to the next page https://s3browser.com/.\nAfter installation, you can open on your computer S3 Browser and see the next interface of this program: To start work with the Cloud Console Object Storage, provide your credential information, for this do the following:\non the main Navigation Panel go to Accounts, choose Add new account: fill in fields on the following page as shown below press Add new account: After these steps, a connection to the Cloud Console Object Storage through the S3 browser is established and you can see all owned buckets and to manage them:\nTo add a new bucket or delete a bucket just by clicking on the one of the buttons: To make bucket public or private go to Permissions tab and select the necessary option: So, as you can see, using the Cloud Console Object Storage through the S3 Browser is as easy as using programming languages.\n"},{"uri":"https://docs.ventuscloud.eu/categories/","title":"Categories","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://docs.ventuscloud.eu/tags/","title":"Tags","tags":[],"description":"","content":""}]
