Rest assured, customer support is readily available for any questions or issues you may encounter.\nIntroduction Restore in the Cloud Console is the procedure used to recover backed-up Virtual Machines (VMs) from a saved backup. This process allows you to bring VMs back to their original state using the available backup data.\nRestored VMs will keep their original settings, but you can change their name and flavor during the restore process.\nSo, to initiate a Restore, you first need to have an available Backup. More information about backups can be found here - Backups.\nRestores page To get to the Restores page do the following:\nOpen the Backup Workloads page - select the Backups from the VIRTUAL DATACENTER block in the side-bar menu: Navigate to the Workload details page by clicking on the desired workload name: Select CREATED BACKUPS TAB on the opened Workload details page:\nNavigate to the Backup details page by clicking on the desired backup name: Select RESTORES TAB on the opened Backup details page:\nOn this page you can find all records of the restore operation initiated from the current Backup, with the Restore VM button, Search bar and Actions icon, which opens a list of available management actions for the selected Restore: Actions icon opens the next list of available management actions:\nCancel restore - this option is used to stop ongoing restore; Delete restore - this option is used for the restore removing. Initiate Restore Restore can only be initiated if current Backup and Workload are in available states.\nRestored VMs will keep their original settings, but you can change their name and flavor during the restore process.\nTo restore VMs from Backup, do the following:\nopen the Restores TAB or Backuped VMs TAB on the Backup details page and click on the RESTORE VM icon in the upper left corner; fill in the form on the next opened Restore from Backup window: Restore name - assign a name to the Restore record; Select instances to restore - if the backup includes multiple VMs, select which ones you want to restore: New instance name - assign a new name for the restored VM. If this field is left empty, the VM will be restored with its original name. New instance flavor - select a new flavor for the restored VM. If this field is left empty, the VM will be restored with its original flavor. .\nAfter these steps, the newly created Restore record will be added to the Restores TAB and you can navigate to the Virtual Machines page to see that the restored VM is being created and will be in ACTIVE status in a few minutes:\nThe restore process will bring back all selected VMs to the same state as when they were backed up. They will:\nbe created in the same project; connect to the same network; have the same image and flavor; use the same key pair.\nHowever, you can assign a new name and flavor to the restored VMs during the process. Restore can also be initiated from the CREATED BACKUPS TAB on the Workload details page by clicking on the Actions icon of the appropriate Backup and selecting the Restore from backup action there:\nCancel Restore To cancel the ongoing Restore, do the following:\nidentify Restore, that you want to cancel, on the Restores TAB of the Backup details page; click on the Actions icon and select the Cancel restore in the list of available options; confirm your action on the next opened Confirmation window. After these steps, the selected Restore will be canceled.\nDelete Restore Deleting a Restore will only remove the record of the restore operation. The restored VMs will not be affected or deleted.\nTo delete the Restore, do the following:\nidentify this unnecessary Restore on the Restore TAB of the Backup details page; click on the Actions icon and select the Delete restore in the list of available options; confirm the Restore deletion on the next opened Confirmation window.

Linux Virtual Machine - that was created with the next parameters and has IP: 185.226.41.42: Name: test-1; Flavor: VC-2; Image: ubuntu-server-18.04-LTS-20201111; Key pair: main; Networks: public; Firewalls: default; Volume size: 50. 💡 For more information about creating and configuring these resources, see the following articles: SSH Keys, Virtual Machines.\nConfiguring Firewalls By default, all created Virtual Machines belong to the default Firewall, which allows access to the Internet from the VM, but denies almost all access on the VM from outside, except for objects belonging to the same default Firewall. Thus, using only the default Firewall, we cannot connect to the selected Virtual Machine remotely via SSH.\n📌 Default Firewall allows all outbound traffic and controls the inbound traffic that\u0026rsquo;s allowed to reach the VMs that are associated with the default Firewall too.\nThere are two ways how to resolve this:\nto add an additional Firewall with a rule that will allow incoming traffic to TCP port 22 on the Virtual Machines and assign this Firewall to the VM too; to add the required rule to the Firewall (can be default Firewall) that is already assigned to the Virtual Machine. Create New Firewall with required rule To create new Firewall do the following:\nopen the Firewalls page - for this select the Security from the VIRTUAL DATACENTER block and click on the FIREWALL TAB: on the Firewalls page click on the CREATE FIREWALL icon in the upper left corner; fill in the form on the next opened Create Firewall window and click on the CREATE icon: After these steps, the newly created Firewall will be added to the Firewalls page.\n📌 As a next step, we need to add an additional Firewall with a rule that will allow incoming traffic to TCP port 22 on the Virtual Machines.\nTo add the described above rule to the newly created Firewall do the following:\nopen the Firewall Rules page - for this click on the Name of the corresponding Firewall: on the Firewall Rules page you can see that rules, that allow all outbound traffic, have been already created by default, but can be deleted if needed. To add additional rule here click on the CREATE FIREWALL RULE icon in the upper left corner: fill in the form on the next opened Create Firewall Rule window as shown below and click on the CREATE icon: 📝 This newly added rule will allow access to the TCP port 22 on the all VMs in the created Firewall over the public Internet, but if you want to allow access only on the one selected VM, you need to specify IP of this VM / 32 in the field named Remote IP prefix - example is shown below:\nAfter this wee need to add this configured Firewall to our Virtual Machine.\nTo add this newly created Firewall to our Virtual Machine, do the following:\nopen the Virtual Machines page - for this select the Virtual Machines from the VIRTUAL DATACENTER block: open the Virtual Machine details page - click on the Name of the corresponding Virtual Machine: open the NETWORKS \u0026amp; SECURITY TAB, click on the Actions icon and select the Edit Firewalls in the list of available options: select our newly created firewall from the list on the opened window and click on SAVE: After these steps, the newly added Firewall will be added to the selected VM:\nThis is the first option, how we can configure the Firewall for SSH access - by creating a new one with the required rule.\n📝 Alternatively, we can just add this rule to the default Firewall, that is already assigned to our VM, and these changes will automatically be applied to the VMs.\nAdd required rule to the existing Firewall 📌 You can add and remove rules at any time. Your changes are automatically applied to the VMs that are associated with the corresponding Firewall.\nTo add required rule to the default Firewall you need to do next:\nopen the Firewalls page - for this select the Security from the VIRTUAL DATACENTER block and click on the FIREWALL TAB: open the Firewall Rules page of the default Firewall- for this click on the Name of the corresponding Firewall: on the Firewall Rules page click on the CREATE FIREWALL RULE icon in the upper left corner;\nfill in the form on the next opened Create Firewall Rule window as shown below and click on the CREATE icon: After this, this newly created Firewall Rule will be automatically applied to all Virtual Machine that were attached with this default Firewall.\nConnect using SSH Since we have the public key deployed on our Linux VM, the private key on our local system (for example ~/.ssh/id_rsa) and a Firewall configured to allow incoming traffic on port 22, we can connect to this Virtual Machine remotely from our local server via SSH, just use the next command: ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa username@10.111.22.333\nThe default usernames for various Linux distributions are as follows:\n🟡 Debian - \u0026ldquo;debian\u0026rdquo;;\n🔵 Fedora - \u0026ldquo;fedora\u0026rdquo;;\n🟢 Fedora CoreOS - \u0026ldquo;core\u0026rdquo;;\n🟠 CentOS 7, CentOS 8 - \u0026ldquo;centos\u0026rdquo;;\n🔴 CentOS 9 and later versions - \u0026ldquo;cloud-user\u0026rdquo;.\n🔶 In the case of Windows, the default username is set as \u0026ldquo;ventus\u0026rdquo;.\nReplace username and 10.11.22.333 in the command with your data and specify the appropriate path to your private key.

SeaweedFS Components Non-HA vs. HA Installing SeaweedFS and the CSI Driver Testing RWX Storage Configuring SeaweedFS as RWX Storage in Kubernetes This guide walks you through setting up SeaweedFS as an NFS-like RWX (ReadWriteMany) storage solution in a Kubernetes cluster. We’ll cover:\nWhat SeaweedFS is and why it’s used Non-HA (single-replica) vs. HA (multi-replica) configurations The roles of the Master, Volume servers, and Filer Installing and configuring SeaweedFS and its CSI driver Testing your RWX storage with real applications Production recommendations (e.g., resource limits, scaling, etc.) Why SeaweedFS for RWX Storage? RWX (ReadWriteMany) storage classes allow multiple pods to read and write to the same persistent volume simultaneously. This is essential for workloads that share state or content, such as web applications serving identical static content or workloads that must scale horizontally without losing access to shared data.\nWhile traditional solutions like NFS servers or managed cloud file systems are available, SeaweedFS stands out for its:\nScalability: Designed to handle billions of files efficiently. Simplicity: Easier to set up compared to many distributed block storage solutions. Performance: SeaweedFS provides near O(1) disk seek for small files, and can handle large amounts of data. Flexibility: Supports replication, making it easy to achieve a highly available (HA) setup. SeaweedFS Components Master: Coordinates the cluster and stores metadata about volume locations. A single master can run for a basic setup. For HA, multiple masters (usually 3) are used to form a consensus group. The metadata stored here is relatively small compared to actual file data.\nVolume Server(s): Store the actual file data in \u0026ldquo;volumes.\u0026rdquo; You can have one volume server for a non-HA setup, or multiple for redundancy. Volume servers can replicate data according to your replication policy (e.g., \u0026ldquo;001\u0026rdquo; for one additional copy).\nFiler: The Filer provides a filesystem interface on top of volume servers. It manages directories and file metadata. The Filer is what you point your CSI driver at to gain NFS-like RWX semantics. Typically, the Filer stores minimal metadata compared to the raw data in volumes.\nNon-HA vs. HA Non-HA Setup Single Master, Single Volume Server, Single Filer Simpler and uses fewer resources Recommended for development or testing If the Master or Volume server fails, the data or metadata may become unavailable Example: A single replica of each component (master, volume, filer) with no replication. HA Setup Multiple Masters (e.g., 3), Multiple Volume Servers (e.g., 2), Multiple Filer Replicas Set replication policies (e.g., 001) for automatic data redundancy Failover capabilities: If one Master or Volume server fails, others take over Ideal for production environments Supports horizontal scaling More complex and resource-intensive, but provides continuous availability Production Recommendations:\nSet resource limits on Master, Volume, and Filer pods to ensure stable performance. Use replication settings like 001 to maintain availability during node failures. Employ liveness and readiness probes to ensure pods self-heal. Allocate PVC sizes thoughtfully: Master \u0026amp; Filer PVCs can be relatively small (a few Gi), as they store metadata. Volume servers need larger PVCs depending on your data requirements (e.g., 100Gi or more). Consider using multiple replicas of each component and robust StorageClasses.

You can assign Floating IP to any of your instances provisioned in private networks. This provides great flexibility in management of your network resources.\nSome of the key advantages provided by Floating IPs:\nOnce Floating IP created - it will stay in your project until you explicitly delete it. Regardless if you delete resources to which it attached. It guarantees that you will have your stable static IP for as long as it needed for your infrastructure. You can create multiple Floating IPs per project. You can almost immediately transfer Floating IP from one instance to another without any interruptions to service. Instance itself doesn\u0026rsquo;t know about Floating IP existence. You don\u0026rsquo;t have additional network interface on OS level.

Contact support if you need it.\nThis scenario is very complex and heavily affected by OS settings inside instance.\nBinding to MAC addresses in your network configuration tool (Netplan, systemd-networkd, others) can cause networking failure.\nRouting table affected by new/changed network interfaces can cause networking failure.\nFirewalls with strict rules can cause networking failure.\nPlease. test this scenario in advance in Non-production environment.\nConclusion\nAs you can see, the port modification functionality is very powerful and let you similar functionality with what you can do with physical devices and even beyond that. But as a drawback, it leads to complexity and difficulties in configurations on many levels. We recommend avoiding working directly with ports and consider the usage of more advanced features like Floating IPs and Load Balancers except for cases when you really need it.\nFloating IP Floating IP is an IP address allocated from Public network range by request and associated with specific project. You can assign Floating IP to any of your instances provisioned in private networks. This provides great flexibility in management of your network resources.\nSome of the key advantages provided by Floating IPs:\nOnce Floating IP created - it will stay in your project until you explicitly delete it. Regardless if you delete resources to which it attached. It guarantees that you will have your stable static IP for as long as it needed for your infrastructure. You can create multiple Floating IPs per project. You can almost immediately transfer Floating IP from one instance to another without any interruptions to service. Instance itself doesn\u0026rsquo;t know about Floating IP existence. You don\u0026rsquo;t have additional network interface on OS level. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to care about routing with multiple interfaces. You need to know that:\nFloating IP can be assigned only to instance provisioned in private network with configured router with external gateway. Only one Floating IP can be assigned to instance at one time. You can’t have Floating IP created from range of your private network. Configuration\nCreate private network:\nopenstack network create private\nCreate and configure subnet:\nopenstack subnet create \\ --gateway 10.0.0.1 \\ --dns-nameserver 8.8.8.8 \\ --subnet-range 10.0.0.0/24 \\ --allocation-pool start=10.0.0.10,end=10.0.0.200 \\ --network private \\ private_subnet Create router to let instances in private network access to internet:\nopenstack router create private_gateway\nConfigure gateway for router:\nopenstack router set --external-gateway public private_gateway\nAttach router to private subnet (enable routing):\nopenstack router add subnet private_gateway private_subnet\nCreate a couple of servers in private network:\nopenstack server create \\ --image \u0026#39;centos-8.2-2004\u0026#39; \\ --boot-from-volume 100 \\ --flavor VC-4 \\ --security-group default \\ --network private \\ --key-name ssh_key_name \\ server1 openstack server create \\ --image \u0026#39;centos-8.2-2004\u0026#39; \\ --boot-from-volume 100 \\ --flavor VC-4 \\ --security-group default \\ --network private \\ --key-name ssh_key_name \\ server2 Make sure that servers created in private subnet range and you can\u0026rsquo;t connect to it over internet:\nopenstack server list\nCreate floating IP:\nopenstack floating ip create public\nShow list of floating IPs available:\nopenstack floating ip list\nAssign Floating IP to server1:\n#openstack server add floating ip server1 \u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt;\nopenstack server add floating ip server1 88.218.52.5\nVerify that you can connect to server1 over internet using Floating IP address. Make sure that you allowed SSH access on Cloud Console Firewall - to find more detailed instructions see the article - Firewall Rules:\n#ssh centos@\u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt;\nssh centos@88.218.52.5\nReassign Floating IP to server2:\n#openstack server add floating ip server2 \u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt;\nopenstack server add floating ip server2 88.218.52.5\nConnect to the same Floating IP over SSH and make sure that you are now accessing server2 instead of server1 using the very same address:\n#ssh centos@\u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt;\nssh centos@88.218.52.5\nDelete server2 and verify that Floatin IP still exists in your project and can be reused:\nopenstack server delete server2\nopenstack floating ip list\nAssign Floating IP to server1:\n#openstack server add floating ip server1 \u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt;\nopenstack server add floating ip server1 88.218.52.5\nopenstack floating ip list\nUnassign Floating IP from Any servers:\n#openstack server remove floating ip server1 \u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt;\nopenstack server remove floating ip server1 88.218.52.5\nopenstack floating ip list\nConclusion Floating IP is a great addition to your infrastructure. It\u0026rsquo;s simple to use. It let you great flexibility in performing drop-in replacement of instances. It guarantees you the stability of the IP address - once you created it will be yours until explicit termination. It can highly increase your security by running all of your workload inside a private network still being able to access the environment using jump servers with adding Public IP only for a limited time (maintenance) and others.\nLoad Balancer Load balancer is a feature designed to satisfy the needs of the most complex and modern distributed application architectures. It helps to increase the performance of your application by distributing requests over multiple instances based on the chosen algorithm as well as reduce possible interruption to service caused by failed instances by leveraging instance auto-eviction functionality based on health probes.\nConfiguration\nCreate and configure network:\nopenstack network create private openstack subnet create \\ --gateway 10.0.0.1 \\ --dns-nameserver 8.8.8.8 \\ --subnet-range 10.0.0.0/24 \\ --allocation-pool start=10.0.0.10,end=10.0.0.200 \\ --network private \\ private_subnet openstack router create private_gateway openstack router set --external-gateway public private_gateway openstack router add subnet private_gateway private_subnet Create a couple of servers in private network so we can test Load Balancer.\nThis time we will leverage User Data a.k.a. Cloud-Init feature for automatic preconfiguration of software inside newly created instance without need to login to it.\nPrepare Cloud-Init config (adjust for your OS Distro accordingly):\ncat \u0026lt;\u0026lt; EOF \u0026gt; ./server1.yaml #cloud-config runcmd: - yum install -y nginx - systemctl start nginx EOF cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt; EOF \u0026gt; ./server2.yaml #cloud-config runcmd: - yum install -y httpd - systemctl start httpd EOF Config of server1.yaml will install and start Nginx webserver on server1.

This will dramatically increase your flexibility in upgrade/migration/disaster recovery scenarios but will keep all of the benefits of Load Balancer itself.\nAs result we have:\nInternal network with subnet; Router which let instances access to internet; Preconfigured instances with automatically installed web servers; Fully configured Load Balancers with pool members of two web servers; Floating IP attached to Load Balancer which exposes web services to internet over port 80. Test Load balancer Functionality:\ncurl http://\u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt; curl http://\u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt; As we configured Load Balancer to work using Round Robin algorithm expected result - different responses on each HTTP request. This means that Load Balancer equally distributes traffic between all pool members.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s recommended to use curl instead of your Browser for testing purposes because the Browsers caching mechanism can mess results.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s disable one of the web servers. You can shutdown instance or disable web server.\nExpected result - you will always receive response only from one web server because Load Balancer will automatically detect that backend instance is down.\nRestore your \u0026ldquo;broken\u0026rdquo; webserver and verify that now you receive results again from both web servers (Apache and Nginx).\nChange Load Balancer\u0026rsquo;s algorithm.\nSome applications may benefit from accepting client requests to the same instance instead of distribution across all instances:\nopenstack loadbalancer pool set --lb-algorithm SOURCE_IP web_pool\nVerify that Load Balancer\u0026rsquo;s behavior changed:\ncurl http://\u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt; curl http://\u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt; curl http://\u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt; You should always receive results only from the same server.\nSupported LB Algorithms:\nSOURCE_IP; ROUND_ROBIN; LEAST_CONNECTIONS; SOURCE_IP_PORT; In addition, Load Balancers has a much more broad functionality than it was described above. It supports multiple pools, multiple listeners, SSL offloading, advanced monitors, and other what will be described in Load Balancers dedicated documentation.\nConclusion\nLoad Balancer is a powerful and advanced feature that can enhance multiple aspects of your application starting but not limiting with traffic distribution, fault detection, smooth adding, and removing instances from pools/farms/clusters. In conjunction with private networks, routers, and Floating IP it can become a great entry point for your application.\n"},{"uri":"https://docs.ventuscloud.eu/products/security/manage-firewalls/","title":"VM&#39;s Firewalls","tags":[],"description":"","content":" On this page, you can find an explanation of how to manage Firewalls, related to the selected Virtual Machine, from the Virtual Machine details page in the Cloud Console.\nTable of contents Table of contents VM\u0026rsquo;s NETWORKS \u0026amp; SECURITY TAB Change Firewall set VM\u0026rsquo;s NETWORKS \u0026amp; SECURITY TAB To find all Firewalls, related to the selected Virtual Machine, you need:\nopen the Virtual Machines page - for this select the Virtual Machines from the VIRTUAL DATACENTER block in the side-bar menu: open the Virtual Machine details page - for this click on the Name of the corresponding Virtual Machine: open the NETWORKS \u0026amp; SECURITY page of this VM: On the opened NETWORKS \u0026amp; SECURITY page of this VM you can find information about all Networks, Subnets, Floating IPs and also information about all Firewalls related to this VM.\nIn this article, we are interested in the block of information, where you can find all Firewalls related to the corresponding VM with their Actions icon, which opens a list of available management actions: 💡 Information how to manage Networks, Subnets and Floating IPs from this page, you can find in the article VM\u0026rsquo;s Networks and Interfaces.\nChange Firewall set To add additional Firewall or delete unnecessary one from the selected VM, do the following:\non the opened NETWORKS \u0026amp; SECURITY page of this VM click on the Actions icon and select the Edit Firewalls in the list of available options: remove an unnecessary firewall or select an additional one from the list of previously added firewalls and click on the SAVE icon: After these steps, the newly added Firewall will be added to the selected VM:\n📌 You can add and remove rules of the selected Firewall at any time from the Firewall Rules page and your changes will automatically applied to the VMs, that are associated with the corresponding Firewall.\n💡 For more information about Firewalls and their Rules, please, see the next articles: Firewalls, Firewall Rules.\nAlternatively, you can create new VM and immediately associate it with desired Firewall, during it\u0026rsquo;s creation. 💡 To find information about how to create Virtual Machine use the article Virtual Machines.\n"},{"uri":"https://docs.ventuscloud.eu/tutorials-advanced/","title":"Advanced","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Chapter 4 Advanced Here are tutorials for advanced users of the Cloud Console.\nInstallation OpenStack CLI Working with OpenStack API Organization\u0026#39;s management over API Advanced network scenarios The Site to Site IPSec VPN "},{"uri":"https://docs.ventuscloud.eu/products/databases/database-management/","title":"Database Management","tags":[],"description":"","content":" On this page, you can find an explanation of how to create and delete databases within your main database instance in the Cloud Console.\nTable of contents Table of contents Create Database Delete Database Create Database To create a new database within your main database instance:\nNavigate to the Database Management page Click the CREATE button\nIn the opened window, fill in the following parameters: Name: Enter a name for your new database Charset: Select the character set for the database Collation: Choose the collation for the database Click CREATE to confirm\nDelete Database To delete a database:\nLocate the database you wish to delete in the table of databases Click on the DELETE option next to the database name Confirm the deletion in the popup window\nDeleting a database will permanently remove all its contents.

This directory will hold all your Terraform files for a specific project: mkdir terraform_basic_vm cd terraform_basic_vm Create file provider.tf in terraform_basic_vm folder and add following code: terraform { required_version = \u0026#34;\u0026gt;= 0.14.0\u0026#34; required_providers { openstack = { source = \u0026#34;terraform-provider-openstack/openstack\u0026#34; version = \u0026#34;~\u0026gt; 1.53.0\u0026#34; } } } This is a configuration block for Terraform, an infrastructure as code tool used for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. We will use it in all our examples.\nIn this specific block:\nrequired_version: Specifies the minimum version of Terraform required to run this configuration. In this case, it requires version 0.14.0 or newer.\nrequired_providers: Specifies the providers required by this configuration. Providers are plugins that Terraform uses to interact with different infrastructure APIs. In this block:\nopenstack: Specifies the provider for OpenStack, a cloud computing platform. It includes: source: Specifies where Terraform can find the provider plugin. In this case, it\u0026rsquo;s hosted on the official Terraform registry under the namespace terraform-provider-openstack/openstack. version: Specifies the version constraint for the provider. In this case, it requires version 1.53.0 or newer, but not version 2.0.0. Overall, this configuration ensures that when you run Terraform commands against this project, Terraform will check that it\u0026rsquo;s using at least version 0.14.0 and that it has the required OpenStack provider version installed to manage the OpenStack infrastructure.\nCreate file outputs.tf in terraform_basic_vm folder and add following code. We will use it on first and second examples. output \u0026#34;instance_ip\u0026#34; { value = openstack_compute_instance_v2.example_instance.access_ip_v4 } output \u0026quot;instance_ip\u0026quot;: This line declares an output variable named \u0026ldquo;instance_ip\u0026rdquo;. Outputs in Terraform allow you to extract and display specific information from your infrastructure after it\u0026rsquo;s been created or modified.\nvalue = openstack_compute_instance_v2.example_instance.access_ip_v4: This line specifies the value of the output variable. It retrieves the IPv4 address (access_ip_v4) of an OpenStack compute instance named example_instance. The openstack_compute_instance_v2 is a Terraform resource type that represents an OpenStack compute instance.\nOverall, this output configuration retrieves and displays the IPv4 address of an OpenStack compute instance named example_instance. After applying the Terraform configuration, you can use the terraform output command to view the value of the \u0026ldquo;instance_ip\u0026rdquo; output variable.\nFirst set the required environment variables for the OpenStack provider by sourcing the credentials file. (see https://docs.ventuscloud.eu/products/security/cli-users) source openrc Create a new file named main.tf in terraform_basic_vm folder. This file will contain your Terraform configuration. You can use code from first example.\nCreate id_rsa.pub file and put inside public key (it can be created in another path, do not forger define path in public_key = file(\u0026quot;/path_to_file/id_rsa.pub\u0026quot;) )\nThe first two examples (Basic virtual machine setup and Complex virtual machine setup) imply that all 6 steps have been completed;\nIn the third example (Basic Kubernetes setup), you need to skip the third step, since all the necessary information for connecting to the k8s cluster will be saved to a file.\nInitialize Terraform Before applying the configuration, you need to initialize Terraform in your project directory. This step downloads the necessary plugins and initializes your working directory. terraform init After initializing add code in main.tf and create an execution plan and apply your Terraform configuration. This command generates an execution plan based on your configuration files. It outlines what actions Terraform will take to achieve the desired state: terraform plan Next command applies the execution plan generated by terraform plan. Terraform will prompt you to confirm the action. Type yes and press Enter to proceed. terraform apply Clean Up (optional) terraform destroy Basic virtual machine setup SSH Key Pair Creation\nA SSH key pair named \u0026ldquo;example-keypair\u0026rdquo; is created using the openstack_compute_keypair_v2 resource.

It also covers the available access methods for Object Storage, as well as instructions on how to create, delete, and manage Object Storage Credentials in the Cloud Console.\nTable of contents Table of contents Introduction Object Storage Credentials page Create Object Storage credentials Show secret key Re-generate secret key Delete Object Storage Credentials Introduction What is Object Storage?\nThe Cloud Console Object Storage makes it possible to store data simply and cost-effectively. It provides a fully distributed, API-accessible storage platform that can be integrated directly into applications or used for backup, archiving, and data retention.\nIt’s built for scale and optimized for durability, availability, and concurrency across the entire data set. An Object Storage API differs from a conventional filesystem: instead of directories and files, you manipulate containers where you store objects. A container can hold millions of objects.\nThere is no notion of hierarchy with containers: you cannot nest a container within another, however, you can emulate a nested folder structure with a naming convention for your objects.\nObject Storage access methods\nWe can access Object Storage using different methods:\nIntegrated S3-Browser: The Cloud Console provides its own integrated S3-Browser, which offers a user-friendly interface to manage your Object Storage resources. This browser allows you to browse through folders and files, create new folders, upload files, and perform various other management tasks directly within the Cloud Console.\nAPIs: You can also interact with Object Storage using different APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). APIs enable developers to programmatically access and manipulate Object Storage resources, allowing for more customized and automated workflows.\nThird-Party Tools: Additionally, you have the option to use third-party tools like S3 Browser and Cyberduck, which provide alternative interfaces for managing Object Storage. These tools may offer additional features and functionalities not available in the integrated S3-Browser, catering to specific user preferences and requirements.\nBy offering multiple options to access Object Storage, the Cloud Console allows users to choose the most suitable approach for their storage management needs. Whether through the integrated S3-Browser, APIs, or third-party tools, users can efficiently interact with and manage their Object Storage resources.\nBut before we start to configure and use Object Storage we need to create credentials that include the access key and secret key and will enable secure access to your Object Storage resources, allowing you to manage and interact with your data.\nObject Storage Credentials page To get to the Object Storage Credentials page, select the Storage from the VIRTUAL DATACENTER block in the side-bar menu and click the S3 Browser TAB: On this page you can find created Object Storage credentials in the current Project with the Create or Browse buckets button, Search bar and Actions icon, which opens a list of available management actions for the selected Object Storage credentials: Actions icon opens the next list of available management actions:\nShow access secret - this option is used to find the secret key of the selected Object Storage credentials; Re-generate secret - this option is used to re-generate the secret key of the selected Object Storage credentials; Delete storage - this option is for Object Storage credentials deletion. Please be aware that there are current limitations in the Cloud Console. You can create only one set of Object Storage credentials within one project.\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t created Object Storage Credentials yet, you will find the Create S3 Credentials button available in the upper left corner. Once you have created the credentials, this button will change to the Browse Buckets button, which allows you to access and manage your existing buckets using the integrated S3 browser. Keep in mind that you can only have one set of credentials per project, so ensure you have the necessary credentials before attempting to use the integrated S3 browser for bucket management.\nCreate Object Storage credentials To create a new Object Storage credentials in the Cloud Console, do the following:\ngo to the Object Storage Credentials page and click on the CREATE S3 CREDENTIALS icon in the upper left corner; confirm your action on the next opened window by clicking on the CREATE icon: The next opened page will provide your access secret key and you can save it by clicking on the COPY TO CLIPBOARD icon.\nAfter these steps, the newly created Object Storage credentials will be added to the Object Storage Credentials page.\nPlease be aware that there are current limitations in the Cloud Console. You can create only one set of Object Storage credentials within one project.\nNext steps, how to use Object Storage credentials to connect to the Cloud Object Storage in different ways you can find in the next articles - Integrated S3-Browser and Object Storage Clients.\nShow secret key To show again secret key of the created Object Storage credentials, do the following:\non the Object Storage Credentials page identify Object Storage credentials from what you want to get secret key; click on the Actions icon and select the Show access secret in the list of available options; confirm your action on the next opened window by clicking on the SHOW icon.

After these steps, the downloading process of the selected file will start automatically.\nMake bucket public You can make your bucket public from both the Buckets page and the inside of the selected Bucket page.\nTo make your bucket public from the Buckets page, follow these steps: go to the Buckets page in the Cloud Console; find the bucket you want to make public; click on the Actions icon and select the Make bucket public in the list of available options: confirm your action on the next opened Confirmation window by clicking on MAKE PUBLIC button. To make your bucket public from inside the selected Bucket page, follow these steps: access the Bucket page in the Cloud Console by clicking on the name of the bucket from the Buckets page. inside the bucket on the Panel with Quick Actions, click an option icon that allows you to change the bucket\u0026rsquo;s access permissions: confirm your action on the next opened Confirmation window by clicking on MAKE PUBLIC button. After these steps your bucket will be publicly available and you can obtain a URL that allows direct access to the entire bucket or to individual objects (files or folders) within it. This URL can be shared with others, and they will be able to access the bucket or objects directly through the provided link without requiring any special authentication or permissions.\nMaking a bucket public allows anyone to access its contents without requiring authentication or special permissions. Please be cautious when setting buckets to public, as it may expose sensitive data to the public. Always review and manage access controls carefully to ensure the security of your data.\nGet bucket\u0026rsquo;s public URL You can obtain the URL for S3 bucket only if the bucket is publicly available. In such cases, you can generate a URL that allows direct access to the entire bucket or to individual objects (files or folders) through the provided link. However, if the bucket is not publicly accessible, generating a URL will not grant access, and users will require appropriate authentication and authorization to access the bucket.\nYou can get your bucket\u0026rsquo;s public URL from both the Buckets page and the inside of the selected Bucket page.\nTo get your bucket\u0026rsquo;s public URL from the Buckets page, follow these steps: go to the Buckets page in the Cloud Console; find the bucket which public URL you want to get; click on the Actions icon and select the Show URL in the list of available options: the next opened window will provide your bucket\u0026rsquo;s URL and you can save it by clicking on the COPY TO CLIPBOARD button. To get your bucket\u0026rsquo;s public URL from inside the selected Bucket page, follow these steps: access the Bucket page in the Cloud Console by clicking on the name of the bucket from the Buckets page. inside the bucket on the Panel with Quick Actions, click an option icon that allows you to see bucket\u0026rsquo;s URL (this icon will be available only if your bucket is public): The next opened window will provide your bucket\u0026rsquo;s URL and you can save it by clicking on the COPY TO CLIPBOARD button.\nGet object\u0026rsquo;s public URL You can obtain the URL for a folder or file in an S3 bucket only if the object is set as publicly available. In such cases, you can generate a URL that allows direct access to the object through the provided link. However, if the object is not publicly accessible, generating a URL will not grant access, and users will require appropriate authentication and authorization to access the object.\nTo get an object\u0026rsquo;s public URL, do the following:\naccess the Bucket page in the Cloud Console by clicking on the name of the bucket from the Buckets page; identify the file or folder, which URL you want to get on the Bucket page; click on the Actions icon and select the Show URL in the list of available options: The next opened window will provide your object\u0026rsquo;s URL and you can save it by clicking on the COPY TO CLIPBOARD button.\nMake bucket private You can make your bucket private from both the Buckets page and the inside of the selected Bucket page.\nTo make your bucket private from the Buckets page, follow these steps: go to the Buckets page in the Cloud Console; find the bucket you want to make private; click on the Actions icon and select the Make bucket private in the list of available options: confirm your action on the next opened Confirmation window by clicking on MAKE PRIVATE button. To make your bucket private from inside the selected Bucket page, follow these steps: access the Bucket page in the Cloud Console by clicking on the name of the bucket from the Buckets page; inside the bucket on the Panel with Quick Actions, click an option icon that allows you to change the bucket\u0026rsquo;s access permissions: confirm your action on the next opened Confirmation window by clicking on MAKE PRIVATE button. After these steps, your bucket will not be publicly available.\nThe access permissions will not allow the public to access the bucket or its contents through any direct URL. The objects within the bucket will remain private and can only be accessed by users with appropriate authentication and authorization.\nDelete and multi-delete objects To delete an object from S3 Bucket, do the following:\naccess the Bucket page in the Cloud Console by clicking on the name of the bucket from the Buckets page; identify the file or folder, that you want to delete on the Bucket page; click on the Actions icon and select the Delete in the list of available options: confirm your action on the next opened Confirmation window by clicking on the DELETE button. After these steps, the selected file or folder will be deleted.\nAlso, the integrated S3 browser allows you to perform multiple deletions of files and folders using the following steps:\nselect the checkboxes of the files or folders that you want to delete; click on the delete icon which will become enabled on the Panel with Quick Actions once you have selected at least one object (file or folder): confirm your action on the next opened Confirmation window by clicking on the DELETE button. After these steps, the selected objects will be deleted in a few seconds.\n📌 Best practice for large datasets\nFor buckets containing large datasets with numerous files, manually deleting objects one by one or even using multi-delete functionality can be time-consuming and inefficient. In such cases, the best practice is to use the retention policy feature, which provides automated cleanup functionality.\n💡 To learn more about setting up and managing retention policies for your buckets, please see the section - Set bucket retention policy.\nSet bucket retention policy The integrated S3 browser allows you to set a retention policy for your bucket, which provides automatic cleanup functionality for managing large datasets. This feature enables you to specify the number of days after which files will be automatically and permanently removed from the bucket. The bucket itself will never be deleted by the retention policy and will remain intact and functional.\nTo set a retention policy for your bucket, do the following:\naccess the Bucket page in the Cloud Console by clicking on the name of the bucket from the Buckets page; inside the bucket on the Panel with Quick Actions, click an option icon that allows you to set the bucket’s retention policy:\non the next opened window specify the number of days for the retention period (files older than this number of days will be permanently removed) and click on the SET button:\nAfter these steps, the retention policy will be active for your bucket. All files that are older than the specified number of days will be automatically and permanently deleted from the bucket. The bucket itself will never be affected by this policy and will remain available for new uploads and continued use.\n📌 Once a retention policy is applied to a bucket, you cannot modify the existing policy settings. If you need to change the retention period, you must first delete the current policy and then set a new one with the desired settings.\nSetting a retention policy will permanently delete files older than the specified number of days. This action cannot be undone. Please ensure you have proper backups of important data before applying a retention policy. This feature is particularly useful for managing large datasets that require regular cleanup. Remember that the bucket itself will never be deleted by the retention policy.\n⚠️ Lifecycle Configuration Shadowing: If you’ve previously set up custom lifecycle rules on your bucket using the S3 API or other tools, please note that these may shadow the retention policy set through the Cloud Console. To avoid unexpected behavior, review and adjust any existing lifecycle rules before applying a new policy.\nFast bucket cleanup technique To quickly delete all files from a bucket with large amounts of data:\nSet a retention policy to 1 day Wait for automatic cleanup to complete Remove the retention policy before uploading new files This method will clear all bucket content while keeping the bucket itself intact.\n⚠️ CRITICAL: You must delete or change the 1-day retention policy before uploading any new files, otherwise new uploads will also be automatically deleted after one day.\n💡 This technique is the fastest way to empty buckets containing thousands of files, much more efficient than manual deletion methods.\nDelete retention policy To delete an existing retention policy from your bucket, do the following:\naccess the Bucket page in the Cloud Console by clicking on the name of the bucket from the Buckets page; inside the bucket on the Panel with Quick Actions, click an option icon that allows you to delete the bucket’s retention policy:\nconfirm your action on the next opened Confirmation window by clicking on the DELETE button. After these steps, the retention policy will be removed from your bucket, and no automatic file deletion will occur. You can then set a new retention policy if needed.\nDelete bucket To avoid any potential data loss during the deletion process, in the Cloud Console, you can only delete a bucket if it is empty.\nBefore deleting a bucket, all files must be removed. To empty your bucket efficiently, you can either use the Fast bucket cleanup technique with retention policy for large datasets, or the multi-delete functionality for smaller amounts of data.\nYou can delete bucket from both the Buckets page and the inside of the selected Bucket page but before, please ensure that all the objects (files and folders) inside the bucket have been removed or moved to another location.\nTo delete bucket from the Buckets page, follow these steps: go to the Buckets page in the Cloud Console; find the bucket you want to delete; click on the Actions icon and select the Delete in the list of available options: confirm your action on the next opened Confirmation window by clicking on DELETE button. To delete bucket from inside the Bucket page, follow these steps: access the Bucket page in the Cloud Console by clicking on the name of the bucket from the Buckets page; inside the bucket on the Panel with Quick Actions, click an option icon that allows you to delete bucket: confirm your action on the next opened Confirmation window by clicking on DELETE button.

Use the following block of code to implement this:\nprivate_key = bucket.get_key(\u0026#39;hello.txt\u0026#39;) hello_url = hello_key.generate_url(0, query_auth=False, force_http=False) print (hello_url) For private objects we can generate a time-limited, signed download URL, that will be operational for a specific duration, after which it will become invalid.\nUse the following block of code to implement this:\nprivate_key = bucket.get_key(\u0026#39;private_data.txt\u0026#39;) private_url = private_key.generate_url(3600, query_auth=True, force_http=False) print (private_url) Please, notice here, when a client application accesses buckets, it always operates with the credentials of a particular user. As every user belongs to a particular project, therefore, for using this links you should add your project ID before your bucket name, and the working links in both examples will look like this: for publicly readable objects - \u0026ldquo;https://upper-austria.ventuscloud.eu:8080/Your_Project_ID:new-bucket-using-python/hello.txt\u0026quot;;\nfor private objects - \u0026ldquo;https://upper-austria.ventuscloud.eu:8080/Your_Project_ID:new-bucket-using-python/private_info.txt?Signature=XXX\u0026amp;Expires=1316027075\u0026amp;AWSAccessKeyId=XXX\u0026quot;\nFind your Project ID you can:\non the Overview page in the Cloud Console: in the link, when you use Cloud Console;\nDelete object To delete an object from the bucket, use the next code block:\nbucket.delete_key(\u0026#39;hello.txt\u0026#39;) It deletes a file \u0026ldquo;hello.txt\u0026rdquo; from the bucket.\nDeleting bucket To delete a whole bucket use the next code block:\nconn.delete_bucket(\u0026#34;1-bucket-using-python\u0026#34;) It deletes the whole bucket called \u0026ldquo;1-bucket-using-python\u0026rdquo;.\nUse Object Storage with third-party tools Another way to utilize the Cloud Console Object Storage and manage data stored in it is by using third-party tools.\nSome of these tools include:\nS3 Browser - a freeware Windows client that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the Cloud Console Object Storage. You can find more information about it at https://s3browser.com/.\nCyberduck - a libre server and cloud storage browser available for both Mac and Windows operating systems. It offers seamless integration with the Cloud Console Object Storage and can be accessed at https://cyberduck.io/.\nIn this section, we will explore how to use the Windows client S3 Browser to interact with the Cloud Console Object Storage and manage your data effectively.\nTo download and install it on your computer, go to the next page https://s3browser.com/.\nAfter installation, you can open on your computer S3 Browser and see the next interface of this program: To start work with the Cloud Console Object Storage, provide your credential information, for this do the following:\non the main Navigation Panel go to Accounts, choose Add new account: fill in fields on the following page as shown below press Add new account: After these steps, a connection to the Cloud Console Object Storage through the S3 browser is established and you can see all owned buckets and to manage them:\nTo add a new bucket or delete a bucket just by clicking on the one of the buttons: To make bucket public or private go to Permissions tab and select the necessary option: So, as you can see, using the Cloud Console Object Storage through the S3 Browser is as easy as using programming languages.\n"},{"uri":"https://docs.ventuscloud.eu/categories/","title":"Categories","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://docs.ventuscloud.eu/tags/","title":"Tags","tags":[],"description":"","content":""}]
