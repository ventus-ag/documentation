![](../../../assets/images/conn-lin/8.png?classes=border,shadow)

- open the *NETWORKS & SECURITY page of this VM* - for this click on the NETWORKS & SECURITY TAB:

On the opened page you can find *two blocks*:
1. the first upper block contains information about all Networks related to the selected VM;
2. the second one contains information about all Firewalls related to this VM:

In this article we are interested in the first upper block of the opened page, where you can find all Networks related to the corresponding VM with their *Headers*, *Add Interface button*, *Search bar* and *Actions icon*, which opens a list of available management actions for the selected Network: 
![](../../../assets/images/networks/9.png?classes=border,shadow)    
Information about the second block of this page you can find in the article [VM's Firewalls]().

## Add Interface
To add additional Interface to the selected VM, do the following:
- click on the ADD INTERFACE icon;
- select one of the available Networks, specify *Fixed IPs* on the next opened *Add interface window* and click on the ADD icon:
![](../../../assets/images/networks/10.png?classes=border,shadow)

You can select only Networks that have associated Subnets.  
The Fixed IPs should be selected from the Allocation pools of the corresponding Subnet.
{{% /notice %}}

After these steps, the newly added Interface will appear in the first top block of the NETWORKS & SECURITY TAB of the *selected VM detailed page* with the status ACTIVE.  
Now you can open its *Subnets page* by clicking on the **Name** of the corresponding Network:
![](../../../assets/images/networks/11.png?classes=border,shadow)  

On this page you can find all Subnets, related to the selected Network, with their *Headers*, *Create button*, *Search bar* and *Actions icon*, which opens a list of available management actions for the selected Subnet:
