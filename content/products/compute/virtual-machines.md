To get to the *Virtual Machines page*, select the **Virtual Machines** from the VIRTUAL DATACENTER block in the *side-bar menu*:
![](../../../assets/images/vms/1-vm.png?classes=border,shadow)  

On this page you can find all created Virtual Machines in the current Project of the selected Organization, with their *Headers, Create button, Search bar* and *Actions icon*, which opens a list of available management actions for the selected VM:
![](../../../assets/images/vms/2-vm.png?classes=border,shadow)   

**Actions** icon opens the next list of available management actions:
- *Start* - this option is used to start the VM if it was stoppedd; 
- *Stop* - this option is used to stop the VM;
- *Soft reboot* - this option is used a graceful shut down and restart of the VM;
- *Edit* - this option is used to change VM's name;
- *Resize* - this option is used to change the Flavor for the VM;
- *Delete* - this option is for VM removing;
- *Remote console* - this option is used to use remote console for VM;
- *Download RDP file* - this option is available only for Windows VMs and is used to download RDP file for the remote connection to the Windows VMs;

## Create Linux Virtual Machine
To create new Linux VM, do the following:
- go to the *Virtual Machines page* and click on the CREATE VM icon in the upper left corner;
- fill in the form on the next opened *Create Virtual Machine window* and click on the CREATE icon:
![](../../../assets/images/vms/3-vm.png?classes=border,shadow)
  - *Source* - choose the source wich you want to use for VM creating: image, volume or snapshot;
  - *OS Platform* - choose the OS Platform wich you want to use for VM creating: Linux or Windows (in this example it will be Linux);
  - *Image ID* - set the ID of the previousluy selected Source for VM creating (Image ID, Volume ID or Snapshot ID); 
  - *Name* - set a name for the VM;
  - *Tags* - this field is optional; use it if you need to set some tags for the VM; 
  - *Flavor* - select the size for new VM;
  - *Key pair* - this field is necessary only for Linux VMs; select here the SSH Key that was previously created on the *SSH Keys page* or create a new one, which you will use to connect to the Linux VM;
  - *Networks* - choose one or more networks;
  - *Firewalls*- choose what collection of network access rules will control the traffic to this VM;  
    >**NOTE:** To connect to the selected **Linux Virtual Machine** remotely via SSH, you need to add an additional Firewall with a rule, that will allow incoming traffic to TCP port 22 (like shown below) - to find additional information about this, please see the article **[Access Linux VM](https://docs.ventuscloud.eu/products/compute/connect-linux-vm/)**;
    ![](../../../assets/images/vms/4-vm.png?classes=border,shadow)

  - *Volume size (GB)* - provide the preferred disk size for the VM, it can be specified in the range from 10 GB to 1000 GB. Minimal available size for Linux VMs - 10 GB; and also just below this field you can make a mark ***for auto-deleting volume*** when the VM is terminated;   

After these steps, the newly created Linux VM will be added to the *Virtual Machine page* with the status ACTIVE:

  - *Name* - set a name for the VM;
  - *Tags* - this field is optional; use it if you need to set some tags for the VM; 
  - *Flavor* - select the size for new VM;
  - *Password* - this field is necessary only for Windows VMs;come up with the root password (it must contain at least one Latin letter in upper case, one Latin letter in lower case, digit, special character, and must be at least 8 characters long);
  - *Confirm password;*
  - *Networks* - choose one or more networks;
  - *Firewalls*- choose what collection of network access rules will control the traffic to this VM; 
    >**NOTE:** To connect to the selected **Windows Virtual Machine** remotely via RDP you need to add an additional Firewall with a rule that will allow incoming traffic to TCP port 54000 like shown below - to find additional information about this, please see the article **[Access Windows VM](https://docs.ventuscloud.eu/products/compute/connect-windows-vm/)**;
