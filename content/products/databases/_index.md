___
Here you can find an explanation of how to create, manage and use Databases in the Cloud Console.

{{% notice note %}}
Please be aware that the Database-as-a-Service feature in the Cloud Console is currently in beta. This means it has not been fully tested across all use cases but aims to provide a user-friendly way to manage a variety of databases. If you're willing to accept the associated risks of using a beta service, you're welcome to proceed. Be sure, customer support is readily available for any questions or issues you may encounter.   
For a more stable experience, you may also consider using more established database providers.  
In beta releases, users should be cautious that:  
- Functionality may be limited or subject to change.  
- There may be bugs or performance issues.  
- Data loss is a possibility, so ensure you have adequate backups.
- Your feedback is valuable for improving the service.
