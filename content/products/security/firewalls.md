All VMs have a default Firewall which is applied to every VM.  

User cannot delete default Firewall or change its Name/Description but can change its rules.  

Default Firewall Rules allow access to the Internet from the VMs, but deny almost all access on the VMs from outside, except for objects belonging to the same default Firewall.
