![](../../../assets/images/fw/1.png?classes=border,shadow) 

On this page you can find *default* Firewall, all your own Firewalls created in the current Project, and the Firewalls created during Cluster creation, with their *Headers*, *Create button*, *Search bar* and *Actions icon*, which opens a list of available management actions for the selected Firewall:

{{% notice note %}}
All VMs have a default Firewall which is applied to every VM.  
The user cannot delete default Firewall or change its Name or Description but can change its rules.  
Default Firewall allows access to the Internet from the VMs, but denies almost all access on the VMs from outside, except for objects belonging to the same default Firewall.  
{{% /notice %}}

**Actions** icon opens the next list of available management actions but isn't active for default Firewall:
- *Edit* - this option is used to change the name and/or description of the selected Firewall;
- *Delete* - this option is for Firewall deletion.

## Create Firewall
To create new Firewall, do the following:
- open the *Firewalls page* and click on the CREATE FIREWALL icon in the upper left corner;
- fill in the form on the next opened *Create Firewall window*:
![](../../../assets/images/fw/3.png?classes=border,shadow)
  - *Name* - set a name for the Firewall; 
  - *Description* - set a description for the Firewall.

After these steps, the newly created Firewall will be added to the *Firewalls page*.  

Now you can open this *Firewall Rules page* - for this click on the **Name** of the corresponding Firewall:
![](../../../assets/images/fw/5.png?classes=border,shadow)  

On this page you can find:
- panel with available **quick actions** for the selected Firewall: 
![](../../../assets/images/networks/13.png?classes=border,shadow) 
- all Rules, related to the selected Firewall, with their *Headers*, *Create button*, *Search bar* and *Actions icon*, which opens a list of available management actions for the selected Rule:
![](../../../assets/images/fw/4.png?classes=border,shadow)  

As you can see, the rules, that allow all outbound traffic, have been already created by default, but you can delete them by using **Actions** icon or add additional rule here by using CREATE FIREWALL RULE button.
