On this page you can find all your own Volumes, created in the current Project, and the Volumes created during Cluster and VM creation, with their *Headers*, *Create button*, *Search bar* and *Actions icon* which opens a list of available management actions for the selected Volume:
![](../../../assets/images/vol/3.png?classes=border,shadow) 

**Actions** icon opens the next list of available management actions:
- *Attach* - this option is used to attach the Volume to the VM; you can attach only Volumes with state *available*;  
- *Detach* -  this option is used to detach the Volume to the VM; you can detach only Volumes with state *in-use*;  
- *Edit* - this option is used to change the Volume name;
- *Extend* - this option is used to change the Volume size; volume extension will restart the VM it is attached to;
- *Delete* - this option is for Volume deletion.

There are two ways to *attach*, *detach*, *edit* and *extend* Volumes:
1. from the *Volumes page*;
2. from the *VOLUMES TAB* on the *Virtual Machine details page*.

In this article we will explain the first way - to manage Volumes from the *Volumes page*. Information about the second one you can find in the next article - [VM's Volumes](https://docs.ventuscloud.eu/products/storage/manage-volumes/).
