## Routers
Router is an important infrastructure component that can come in handy when you need to:  
- Provide access to the internet for instances provisioned in a private network;  
- Interconnect two or more networks;  
- Manage routes for traffic in advanced network scenarios;  

## Routers page
To get to the *Routers page*, select the **Networking** from the VIRTUAL DATACENTER block in the *side-bar menu* and click the **Routers TAB:**

![](../../../assets/images/routers/1.png?width=20pc&classes=border,shadow) 

On this page you can find all Routers created in the current Project, with the *Create button*, *Search bar* and *Actions icon*, which opens a list of available management actions for the selected Routers:

**Actions** icon opens the next list of available management actions for the selected Router:
- *Edit* - this option is used to update name/description of the selected Router; 
- *Delete* - this option is for the Router removing.

## Create Router 

To create new Router, do the following:
- go to the *Routers page* and click on the CREATE ROUTER in the upper left corner;  
- fill in the form on the next opened *Create Router window* and click on the CREATE icon:

![](../../../assets/images/routers/3.png?width=35pc&classes=border,shadow)  
  - *Name* - set a name for the Router; 
  - *Description* - set a description for the new Router;
  - *Enable external gateway* - select it if you want to use the router as a gateway for instances created in private network. In other words, it will let instances from private network access to internet. 

After these steps, the newly created Router will be added to the *Routers page* with the status ACTIVE.  

### Add Interface to the Router

To add Interfaces to the already created Router do the following:
- ensure that you have already created Network with associated Subnets;  
  To find information about how to create internal Network and Subnet use the articles [Networks](https://docs.ventuscloud.eu/products/networking/networks/), [Subnets](https://docs.ventuscloud.eu/products/networking/subnets/);
- open the *Router details page* - for this, click on the **Name** of the corresponding Router:

- click on the ADD INTERFACE icon:

- select one of the available Subnets and click on the ADD icon:

![](../../../assets/images/routers/6.png?width=35pc&classes=border,shadow)

After these steps, the newly added Interface will appear in the *Router details page* in the ACTIVE status with available action icon for its removing. Now, all Virtual Machines created in this Subnet will have access to the internet, as this Router was created with *Enabled external gateway*:
