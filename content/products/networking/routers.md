## Routers
Router is an important infrastructure component that can come in handy when you need to:  
- Provide access to the internet for instances provisioned in a private network;  
- Interconnect two or more networks;  
- Manage routes for traffic in advanced network scenarios;  

## Routers page
To get to theÂ *Routers page*,Â select theÂ **Networking**Â from the VIRTUAL DATACENTER block in the *side-bar menu* and click theÂ **Routers TAB:**

![](../../../assets/images/routers/1.png?width=25pc&classes=border,shadow) 

On this page you can find all Routers created in the current Project, with theÂ *Create button*,Â *Search bar*Â and *Actions icon*,Â which opens a list of available management actions for the selected Routers:

**Actions**Â icon opens the next list of available management actions for the selected Router:
- *Edit*Â - this option is used to update name/description of the selected Router;Â 
- *Delete*Â - this option is for the Router removing.

## Create Router 

To create new Router, do the following:
- go to theÂ *Routers page*Â and click on theÂ CREATE ROUTER in the upper left corner;  
- fill in the form on the next openedÂ *Create Router window* and click on the CREATE icon:

![](../../../assets/images/routers/3.png?width=35pc&classes=border,shadow)  
  - *Name* - set a name for the Router;Â 
  - *Description*Â - set a description for the new Router;
  - *Enable external gateway* - select it if you want to use the router as a gateway for instances created in private network. In other words, it will let instances from private network access to internet. 

After these steps, the newly created Router will be added to theÂ *Routers page* with the status ACTIVE.  

### Add Interface to the Router

Router can be connected to one or more private networks by adding it's interface to network.

To add Interfaces to the already created Router do the following:
- ensure that you have already created Network with associated Subnets;  
  ðŸ’¡ To find information about how to create internal Network and Subnet use the articles [Networks](https://docs.ventuscloud.eu/products/networking/networks/), [Subnets](https://docs.ventuscloud.eu/products/networking/subnets/);
- open the *Router details page* - for this, click on theÂ **Name**Â of the corresponding Router:

- click on theÂ ADD INTERFACEÂ icon:

![](../../../assets/images/routers/5.png?classes=border,shadow) 

- select one of the available Subnets and click on theÂ ADDÂ icon:

{{% notice note %}}
ðŸ“Œ If Router was created with *Enabled external gateway* all Virtual Machines created in this Subnet will have access to the internet.
{{% /notice %}}


After these steps, the newly added Interface will appear in theÂ *Router details page* in the ACTIVE status with available *action icon* for its removing. Now, all Virtual Machines created in this Subnet will have access to the internet, as this Router was created with *Enabled external gateway*:
