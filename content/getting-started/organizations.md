## Organizations page
If you are a new user and have just created new account, you will be automatically redirected to the *Organizations page*, where you can create your first Organization or find a list of Organizations, to which Projects your User has access as a *Member*:  

If you aren't a new User, but want to see information about created Organizations or find information about Organizations to which Projects your User has access, you need to select the **Organizations** from the *side-bar menu:*
